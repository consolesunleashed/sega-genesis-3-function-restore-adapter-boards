# Sega Genesis 3 Function Restore Adapter Boards

Sega Genesis 3 function restore helper boards to make wiring easier and cleaner when restoring the removed functions from Sega Genesis 3 consoles. Especially useful for "VA1" revision which requires soldering between the cartridge port plastic and PCB.

##Mod Kit Variants

The function restore boards come in two main versions catered for the "VA1" and the VA2 revision Genesis 3 motherboards.

- VA1 Standard - Looks awesome.
- VA1 Mini - A smaller version.
- VA1 Mini Compensated - A smaller version with pads in order of destination solder point so no wires need to be crossed.
- VA2 standard - Quick solder board with pads for Mega CD passthrough audio.
- VA2 Mini - A smaller version without the Mega CD audio pads.

## Manufacturing

- 0.6mm is ideal. 0.8mm is also good. 1mm is ok. 1.2mm is too much. 1.6mm is stupid.
- Get them in blue or else.
- Castellated vias are recommended. Failure to get castellated will mean the half cut vias will need cleaning and also potentially have torn off copper plating during manufacturing.

## Version History

Coming soon.
